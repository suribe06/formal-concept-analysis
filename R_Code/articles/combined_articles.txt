organizaciones internacionales los organismos donantes nacionales uti lizan cada vez mas las intervenciones en las cadenas globales de valor cgv en el contexto de estrategias de desarrollo del sector privado estas politicas programas se centran en mejorar las condiciones de acceso al mercado apoyar los procesos de modernizacion de las empresas de paises en desarrollo en las cgv con el objetivo mas amplio de promover el desarrollo basado en el mercado menudo orientado la exportacion del sector privado sin embargo pesar de esta practica en aumento de las politicas programas de cadenas de valor parece que hay poca claridad acerca de que son esos programas que deberian ser que objetivos deberian perseguir que caracteristicas deberian tener para diferenciarse de los enfoques mas tradicio nales de hecho los programas implementados difieren en varias cuestiones sobre todo en lo que respecta sus principales objetivos su foco explicito ii el alcance de las intervenciones los niveles abordados iii los patrones de compromiso los sectores actores en los cuales se centran en este trabajo se argumenta que es necesario comprender de manera profunda las cgv lo que las impulsa sus estructuras de gobernanza para que las intervencio nes en cadenas de valor sean efectivas el surgimiento de las cadenas de valor esta cambiando drasticamente la organizacion de la produccion en los niveles mundial regional local los enfoques de cadenas de valor pueden servir como base para disenar politicas programas efectivos fin de fomentar el desarrollo empresarial el aprendizaje la innovacion sin embargo las intervenciones actuales de gobiernos donantes en cadenas de valor abarcan con demasiada frecuencia tal variedad de enfoques que corren el riesgo de perder el foco transformar las intervenciones en

dentro de este marco este trabajo ofrece un analisis de las intervenciones en cadenas de valor analiza su logica justificacion politica subyacentes asimismo se desarrolla una tipologia de intervenciones en cadenas de valor llevadas cabo por organizaciones donantes internacionales se estudia en profundidad el caso de una organizacion multilateral con evidencia original sobre la base de esta eva luacion se identifican temas clave recomendaciones para desarrollar programas de cadenas de valor por que las cadenas de valor requieren politicas publicas la economia mundial ha cambiado significativamente en las tres ultimas decadas en el contexto de la globalizacion que esta teniendo un efecto en la organizacion de la produccion en los niveles mundial regional local una parte cada vez mayor del comercio mundial el pib el empleo se estructuran en torno cadenas de valor fragmentadas geograficamente dispersas donde las corporaciones transnacionales dividen los procesos de produccion en diferentes partes los ubican en una escala mundial las actividades que componen una cadena de valor pueden tener una base local pero menudo se llevan cabo en redes entre empresas en una escala mundial regional gereffi et al gereffi kaplinsky estos cambios en la organizacion de la produccion mundial suponen tanto opor tunidades como amenazas las empresas los productores los trabajadores de los paises en desarrollo la participacion en cgv puede facilitar el acceso mercados externos diversificados economias de escala alcance aprendizaje tecnologico transferencia de conocimientos acceso importaciones sin embargo la integracion en las cgv tambien puede atrapar empresas paises en actividades con poco valor agregado que dependen de ventajas competitivas estaticas lo que es mas impor tante existen asimetrias significativas entre diferentes paises en desarrollo dentro de los mismos en lo que respecta la capacidad de las empresas los estados de aprovechar las oportunidades las politicas publicas pueden desempenar un papel estrategico este respecto el debate sobre politicas publicas en el contexto de las cgv es parte del debate mas amplio sobre el papel del estado del mercado en el proceso de desarrollo el debate se ha centrado tradicionalmente en la existencia de las fallas del mercado tales como las economias de escala la competencia imperfecta el poder de mercado la incertidumbre las externalidades los derrames spillovers del conocimiento para justificar la necesidad de politicas publicas este es particularmente el caso de los paises en desarrollo aunque solo en ellos donde los mercados son muy imperfectos sub desarrollados inexistentes en los que la incertidumbre es generalizada pietrobelli las fallas de coordinacion representan una justificacion mas para las politicas publicas el desempeno de las empresas individuales depende de forma crucial del comportamiento de otros actores por ejemplo decisiones de produccion e inversion en las fases iniciales finales provision de infraestructura bienes publicos pero los mercados con frecuencia les faltan los medios para inducir un comportamiento coherente lo que lleva una asignacion de

un determinante clave de las intervenciones en las cadenas de valor estas fallas en el mercado la coordinacion son particularmente relevantes en el contexto de las cgv en primer lugar el acceso los mercados tiene cada vez menos lugar en relaciones de mercado entre partes independientes sino que requiere entrar en redes construir relaciones con empresas lideres proveedores mundiales sus intermediarios para las empresas individuales en paises en desarrollo tener acceso empresas lideres sus redes es un desafio crucial que requiere estar consciente de la situacion e inversiones especificas una vez que una empresa de un pais se ha ganado la reputacion un contrato de una empresa lider es mas facil que otras empresas la sigan esto representa una externalidad justifica el apoyo

principio las empresas lideres podrian desempenar un papel de coordinacion crucial en las cgv pero estas empresas solo apoyaran los procesos de modernizacion de las empresas locales si hacerlo ayuda su interes estrategico supone una amenaza para sus principales competencias el costo de cambiar otros proveedores es excesivo es decir que las externalidades sean limitadas el alto riesgo la

competencia entre empresas dificultando la captacion de rentas mantienen las actividades para las cuales las barreras de entrada son altas las rentas prevalecen estas barreras de entrada pueden surgir de elevados requisitos tecnolo gicos organizativos de habilidades pero tambien del poder de la capacidad de crear esas estructuras de mercado asimetricas si las estructuras de mercado fueran menos asimetricas los mercados trabajaran mas eficazmente en esos segmentos especificos de rentas altas las cadenas de valor trabajarian con mas eficiencia los recursos se asignarian mejor se generarian

clasificacion de las intervenciones diferencia entre aquellas que tie nen como objetivo el acceso las cgv su integracion en ellas aquellas que tienen como objetivo la captura de valor dentro de las cgv el primer tipo de intervenciones es particularmente importante en paises regiones menos desarrollados que estan integrados todavia en las cgv estas intervenciones se centran en atraer inversiones

funcionamiento de las cgv por ejemplo al reducir las barreras al comercio mejorar la logistica otras infraestructuras fisicas sociales mejorar la capacidad de suministro de las empresas locales para interactuar con las cgv por ejemplo al desarrollar habilidades vinculos comerciales el segundo tipo de intervenciones orientadas la captura de valor es particularmente relevante para paises mas desarrollados que ya estan integrados en las cgv pero que buscan acercar mayores beneficios economicos en estas intervenciones la capacidad de algunos organismos han desarrollado un enfoque de cadenas

la cadena por ejemplo mejorar las aptitudes habilidades de los proveedores de insumos locales ii para fortalecer los vinculos entre empresas para hacer mas productiva la ca dena por ejemplo al mejorar

gobierno el sector privado las orga nizaciones de la sociedad civil osc ong los donantes debe diferenciarse los mediadores de los financiadores es posible que los dos se superpongan pero menudo son

de la cadena es decir establecer vinculos hacia atras hacia adelante veces tambien se agrega la entrada es decir introducir nuevos actores que participaban antes en cadenas de valor locales regionales

intervenciones menudo se centran solamente en parte de los problemas de las limitaciones sin un enfoque holistico coherente fernandez stark et al ademas estos estudios tambien sugieren que las intervenciones menudo carecen de coordinacion dentro de una misma organizacion con otros donantes organizaciones ver por ejemplo stamm von drachenfels humphrey navas aleman henriksen et al mitchell

proyectos se llego las siguientes conclusiones en primer lugar se esta implementando una amplia gama de proyectos que difieren en su alcance presupuestos algunos se centran en unas pocas intervenciones especificas mientras que otros abarcan un gran rango de limitaciones en segundo lugar la descripcion de la mayor parte de los proyectos estudiados carece de una discusion de los principales conceptos de seleccion de las cadenas de valor por ejemplo en general se incluye en el resumen de los pro yectos un analisis explicito sobre las empresas lideres las estructuras de gobernanza la distribucion de las rentas del valor agregado en algunos proyectos la mejora se reduce al acceso la cadena la eficiencia de la produccion sin tomar en cuenta otras dimensiones del escalamiento la consecuencia es que raras veces se identifica e implementa una estrategia de mejora explicita lo que incluye la identificacion de limitaciones oportunidades objetivos en tercer lugar entre los proyectos estudiados pueden identificarse grandes rasgos tres tipos de proyectos cuadro tipo los proyectos de vinculacion en cadenas de valor se centran en pyme pequenos productores principalmente en agricultura actividades de procesamien agrario tienen como meta apoyar su integracion en cadenas de valor locales globales dichos proyectos parecen ser especialmente relevantes para los paises miembros del bid menos desarrollados para las areas rurales los proyectos ge neralmente enfatizan el incremento de la productividad la eficiencia la mejora de los productos la calidad para que puedan integrarse en las cadenas de valor algunos proyectos se centran explicitamente en vinculos horizontales de manera que conectan los productores con otras asociaciones empresariales para facilitar el escalamiento otros se enfocan en establecer mejorar las instituciones privadas publicas para apoyar los productores en terminos de capacitacion cumplimiento de estandares menudo hay un enfasis especifico en mercados compradores finales fernandez stark et al dada la relevancia cuantitativa de estos tipos de proyectos el desarrollo de un enfoque comun seria util esta seccion se ha desarrollado traves de una busqueda detallada de palabras clave en los repositorios de proyectos del bid que parecerian seguir un enfoque de cadena de valor la busqueda pudo ser sistematica consigue

conceptos fundamentales de las cadenas de valor las intervenciones en las cadenas de valor abarcan una variedad de objetivos enfoques definiciones se superponen con otros enfoques de desarrollo del sec tor privado dada la popularidad de las intervenciones en las cadenas de valor hay tambien una tendencia etiquetar iniciativas genericas de apoyo empresas locales sectores privados como intervenciones en cadenas de valor esto crea confusion tiene el riesgo de que estas intervenciones pierdan su foco solo compartan una etiqueta sin un concepto real subyacente es crucial tener un entendimiento comun de los principales conceptos de este enfoque alguna normalizacion de las intervencio nes en cadenas de valor actualmente este entendimiento comun parece faltar en la mayoria de los

intervenciones se ocupan mas especificamente de las barreras que impiden que la gente pobre las mujeres pobres participen en las cadenas de valor se beneficien de su participacion en ellas riisgaard et al un problema con este tipo de focalizacion es que la reduccion de la pobreza puede requerir la diversificacion en diferentes actividades humphrey navas aleman recientemente el enfoque de las cgv se ha expandido para abordar las relaciones entre el crecimiento el upgrading downgrading economico social barrientos et al entender los diferentes impactos de la entrada mejora en las cgv para diferentes grupos de empresas productores trabajadores es crucial para evaluar el impacto en el desarrollo de las intervenciones en cadenas de valor cuadro principios clave necesarios para las intervenciones en las cadenas de valor un entendimiento comun de los conceptos enfoques fundamentales de cadenas de valor que incluyen estructuras de gobernanza relaciones de poder que influyen en las presiones competitivas barreras la entrada las distintas opciones para el escalamiento upgrading el desarrollo de una estrategia de escalamiento medida especifica para el contexto eso requiere una evaluacion de las complejidades de los procesos de escalamiento de sus costos riesgos beneficios la busqueda de un papel util para las empresas lideres los proveedores globales teniendo en cuenta su papel ambivalente en facilitar obstaculizar el escalamiento debido sus intereses potencialmente divergentes de los intereses de los paises sistemas de innovacion solidos e inversiones para el aprendizaje local pueden permitir procesos de escalamiento en las cgv atraer cgv mas dispuestas apoyar el escalamiento la integracion local cluster de empresas acciones colectivas pueden facilitar la modernizacion dentro de las cgv traves de la eficiencia colectiva la provision de bienes club publicos como practica de implementacion de programas participacion cooperacion de las partes publicas privadas interesadas orientadas la creacion de capacidades publicas para la formulacion e implementacion de politicas estrategicas los mercados nacionales regionales emergentes la diversificacion de mercado ofrecen un potencial nuevo e interesante para el escalamiento requieren programas politicas coherentes con las condiciones en dichos mercados programas politicas de cadenas de valor pueden

globales de valor politicas de desarrollo conclusiones el enfoque de las cgv provee un marco analitico util para analizar los procesos globales de produccion las estructuras de gobernanza la distribucion de activida des beneficios riesgos en la economia mundial se trata de un marco multiescalar que va mas alla de los enfoques tradicionales que se centran en el estado nacion en la empresa con este foco en sectores relaciones entre empresas el enfoque de cgv puede integrar lo global con lo local la empresa con el nivel meso macro por lo tanto las politicas programas de cgv pueden ser instrumentos utiles para mejorar la posicion las oportunidades para las empresas los productores de paises en desarrollo en la produccion escala mundial en el comercio internacional en resumen pueden destacarse tres puntos para disenar e implementar eficazmente intervenciones en cadenas de valor en primer lugar la integracion en las cgv debe ser vista como la panacea del desarrollo sino como un espacio de oportunidades que pueden tener importan tes efectos en el desarrollo phillips henderson sin embargo dichas oportunidades requieren politicas estrategicas en diferentes niveles el papel de las empresas lideres de los proveedores mundiales de otros intermediarios en iniciar el aprendizaje la modernizacion puede ser fundamental pero tambien pueden bloquear los procesos de modernizacion escalamiento deben evaluarse los beneficios los obstaculos potenciales para cada caso en segundo lugar una perspectiva mas amplia de las intervenciones en cadenas de valor tiene que ir mas alla del analisis estricto de la eficiencia en la produccion basada en el costo la infraestructura debe incluir conceptos criticos como gober nanza estructuras de poder rentas economicas barreras la entrada como tambien las diferentes dimensiones de modernizacion escalamiento el marco institucional local e internacional en tercer lugar los enfoques de cgv tienen el potencial de hacer mas efectivas las intervenciones para el desarrollo del sector privado el desarrollo empresarial sin embargo las intervenciones en cadenas de valor llevadas cabo hasta ahora por organizaciones internacionales donantes todavia abarcan una variedad exce siva de objetivos enfoques conceptos definiciones corren el riesgo de perder foco efectividad stamm von drachenfels por lo tanto se necesita con urgencia una mejora

para toda narrativa sobre derechos humanos la misma denominacion de derechos exige revisar aquellos presupuestos epistemologicos ontologicos sobre los cuales descansa el discurso legitimador de siglos de dependencia despojo la altisima contradictoriedad que ello refleja es sintoma de una hegemonia con una increible capacidad de autoregenerarse visto asi todo analisis sobre los derechos humanos en america latina el caribe pasa por ser un ejercicio procedimental un acto de militancia quiere decir que los derechos existen al c ontrario de lo que se trata es de entender la relacion organica entre un regimen de derechos objetivo historicamente condicionado la logica sistemica estructural del capitalismo que lo contiene para enfatizar en esa relacion estructural entre los derechos humanos el sistema de reproduccion del capital este texto aborda un fenomeno especifico el impacto del tratado de libre comercio entre la union europea el ecuador vigente desde estudiar el uso de los tratados para la implementacion de ajustes neoliberales parece cada vez mas importante el objetivo de esta primera reflexion es doble hacer un resumen de los primeros datos economicos en menos de dos anos para desmentir las posturas que defienden un modelo de desarrollo basado en l os tratados de libre comercio entre paises centrales perifericos analizar la coherencia de este modelo con un regimen de reproduccion del capitalismo colonial en el particular contexto de inicios del siglo xxi los gobiernos progresistas la disput politica que acompano estos procesos tomando en cuenta la extension permitida el analisis espera ser ilustrativo mas que exhaustivo porque busca posicionar la disputa de hegemonias politicas que enfrenta hoy la region sudamericana luego de los gobie rnos progresistas ante el embate del neoliberalismo su actual aliado los fundamentalismos en este contexto es imperativo desenmascarar las practicas empresariales gubernamentales bilaterales globales religiosas mediaticas entre otras que malizan el despojo la expropiacion de derechos oportunidades restringen las vias para la democratizacion social se espera evidenciar que los tratados de libre comercio en especifico el que se analiza han posibilitado la implantacion de regulacio nes que sirven la reproduccion del capital contradicen los derechos humanos expandiendo las estrategias de acumulacion por despojo precarizacion de todos los ambitos de la vida la naturaleza son asi una herramienta efectiva con una finalidad p rincipal instrumentalizar la vida humana los bienes naturales culturales de las

lograrse en un contexto democratico se recurrio dictaduras militares gobiernos autoritarios sobre la tierra arrasada se impusieron medidas economicas que habrian sido inviables si se hubiera mantenido la democracia se redujo el salario real se bajaron los impuestos al capital se abrieron las economias al exterior de forma unilateral con una reduccion drastica de los aranceles las importaciones la liberalizacion de los flujos financieros elias la segunda fase de esta ofensiva ocurre desde mediados de los ochenta ha sta fines de los noventa durante esos anos en el marco de la crisis de la deuda externa las dictaduras son desplazadas por democracias que van adoptar las politicas economicas del consenso de washington estas se corresponden con un modelo economico neoclasico caracterizado por una clara orientacion de mercado con apertura externa asumiendo la teoria de las ventajas comparativas por la cual el libre mercado llevaria la convergencia de las economias elias segun este modelo el unico crecimiento viable es el que se da hacia afuera se enfoca en captar inversion extranjera directa en la liberalizacion financiera cuyas tasas de interes seran determinadas por el mercado

de diversificacion de las exportaciones de esos paises con el ecuador al igual que con el patron de las exportaciones del ecuador sus principales socios comerciales en la union europea es probable que este patron de importaciones haya estado presente previo la firma del tratado obstante esta tabla grafica la acelerada profundizacion de ese patron en los dos anos de vigencia del tratado al duplicar en terminos globales las importa ciones de los principales productos con nuestros socios comerciales efectos del tratado quien se beneficia las tres tablas presentadas ejemplifican los efectos globales que ha tenido para el ecuador la firma del tratado comercial con la union e uropea en sus dos primeros anos resalta ante todo una caida bastante pronunciada de la balanza comercial global del ecuador con la union europea lo que anula de partida gran parte de los argumentos favor de la firma del tratado sobre todo aquellos que hablaban de beneficios estructurales para la economia ecuatoriana en tan solo dos anos la caida de la balanza comercial ha sido de por lo que de seguir la tendencia esta pronto sera negativa vale decir que existen sectores que como se evid encia en la segunda tercera tablas si se han beneficiado del tratado comercial los exportadores de materias primas e importadores de bienes intermedios finales otro punto importante considerar es el escaso incremento de las exportaciones primarias la union europea que estimado en funcion de los principales productos se ha incrementado en apenas esto pudo haberse dado por algunas medidas de proteccion de la union europea entre ellas las barreras paraarancelarias que tiene como normas sa nitarias fitosanitarias certificados de calidad con metodologias unilaterales certificados de huella ambiental huella de carbono ecoetiquetas por la politica agraria comun de la union europea que subsidia la produccion agricola de los paises miembros de la union dificultando el ingreso por importaciones de productos competidores adicionalmente esto es un punto de menor consideracion al ser el ecuador una economia sin moneda propia anclada la dolarizacion es tambien dependiente par el sostenimiento de su moneda de flujos comerciales positivos en el tiempo que permitan un adecuado balance entre el ingreso la salida de divisas una caida tan abrupta de la balanza comercial del ecuador con la union

devastador para la economia en su conjunto escenarios tan extremos como el cambio de moneda la casi absoluta dependencia flujos financieros externos para sostener el dolar con todo la gran consecuencia que se evidencia de estos dos anos de tratado comercial entre el ecuador la union europea es que se profundiza el patron de especializacion productiva del ecuador como exportador de materias primas e importador de bienes intermedios finales lo que esta tambien acompanado de dinamicas efectos perniciosos para la economia en su conjunto para la vida de las personas entre ellos es dable distinguir los siguientes los precios de las materias primas tienen mayor volat ilidad menor crecimiento en el tiempo en el mercado internacional adicionalmente la concentracion de las exportaciones en pocos productos incrementa la vulnerabilidad de la economia shocks externos la falta de procesos de agregacion de valor impid e generar concatenaciones de diferentes sectores de la economia lo que su vez impide integrar multiples sectores de la sociedad en la dinamica economica repartiendo en menor medida los ingresos generados por la produccion los empleos que se requieren con una escasa generacion de valor agregado son de menor especializacion lo que se traduce en desincentivos para un mayor desarrollo de capital humano para mayores salarios que devienen de emplear trabajadores con estudios es por esto que la especi alizacion productiva de un pais esta fuertemente relacionada con variables macroeconomicas como el crecimiento sostenido de mediano largo plazos la inequidad la pobreza el subempleo entre otras que afectan directamente la vida de las personas sus derechos humanos impacto del tratado en terminos de derechos humanos en solo dos anos si analizamos estos efectos economicos al trasluz del contexto global podriamos retomar en el analisis algunas de las tesis de autores que han planteado los efect os de mediano largo plazos de la especializacion productiva en productos con escaso valor agregado uno de los principales puntos de referencia en el contexto latinoamericano es raul prebisch quien en el periodo de posguerra planteaba que el deterio ro de los terminos de intercambio la evolucion asimetrica en el tiempo de los precios de los bienes primarios vs los bienes industriales favor de estos ultimos es una de las principales variables que explican el rezago en el nivel relativo de desar rollo de los paises de america latina respecto de los paises industriales asimismo planteaba que los primeros debian transitar de un modelo de

bienes intermedios finales con va lor agregado para poder saldar la brecha de desarrollo prebisch posteriormente autores como cardoso faletto tambien dos santos analizan como estos patrones de especializacion productiva pueden configurar un sistema mundo inequitativo ancl ado en lo que se llego denominar como teoria de centro periferia segun la cual los paises especializados en bienes industriales ocupan el centro los especializados en la produccion de materias primas la periferia generando asi relaciones de dependenc ia comercial que determinan asimetrias de desarrollo economico de poder politico cardoso faletto santos si sumamos al analisis del impacto de los dos primeros anos de vigencia del tratado esta tesis sobre los efectos de mediano plazo podriamos concluir sin mayores complicaciones que el escenario que se dibuja en el horizonte es el del deterioro de las variables macroeconomicas que afectan directamente el desarrollo general del ecuador especialmente la vida de las personas finalm ente para cerrar esta hipotesis sobre las perspectivas economicas del ecuador raiz de la firma del tratado comercial con la union europea podemos sumar los resultados de estudios sobre los procesos de desarrollo historico de los paises actualmente indu strializados en los que politicas como la proteccion arancelaria eran un puntal fundamental en sus estrategias mediano largo plazos el historiador paul bairoch sistematiza como la proteccion comercial ha sido una politica de primera linea en paises considerados actualmente como industrializados traves de recopilar los datos de las tasas de importacion de manufacturas por largos periodos de tiempo un ejemplo de estos resultados es estados unidos que desde principios del siglo xix hasta la posgu erra mediados del xx sostuvo tarifas promedio para bienes manufacturados que oscilaban entre el el de igual manera paises como reino unido ya tenian tasas para bienes manufacturados que llegaban hasta el desde antes de finalizadas l guerras napoleonicas en bairoch existen tambien ejemplos de politicas comerciales aun mas restrictivas en importaciones de manufacturas en procesos de desarrollo industrial mucho mas pronunciados como en el caso de corea del sur en el que la normativa interna le permitia al gobierno durante gran parte de la segunda mitad del siglo xx prohibir incluso la importacion de productos manufacturados que fuesen en contra de los objetivos de industrializacion de los planes quinquenales chang tomando en cuenta todo lo anterior es dable concluir que el acuerdo con la union europea representa una amenaza contundente la garantia de los derechos humanos en ecuador en distintas dimensiones primero porque la firma de este tratado probable mente minara el desarrollo productivo del ecuador al profundizar la especializacion productiva en la exportacion de materias primas con bajo nulo valor agregado la importacion de manufacturas intermedias finales solo

papel como actor economico partir de nacionalizaciones estatizaciones de empresas de sectores estrategi cos como por ejemplo las empresas de hidrocarburos de acuerdo con filmus una via para la relegitimacion del estado fue la confianza en los lideres lo que permitio conducir el proceso de desarrollo recuperar soberania nacional en la toma de decision es dirigir una parte importante de la

privilegios prebendas para las oligarquias grupos multinacionales pablo gentili trotta la pregunta que muchos se han hecho es que paso como se retrocedio tan rapidamente en materia de derechos segun beatriz stolowicz el retroceso es resultado de una contraofensiva imperialista que se sirvio de las burguesias locales para desestabilizar los gobiernos progresistas estos en medi de las contingencias contradicciones que enfrentaron sus procesos de cambio fueron capaces ya de mantener los niveles de compensacion social con que respondian la crisis ni de conservar la base social que tuvieron al inicio segun la autora se necesitaba de una accion mucho mas radical que los gobiernos utilizaran el poder estatal para reducir el poder del capital lo que implicaba admitir el conflicto de clases tomar una postura al respecto stolowicz son asuntos aledanos co ntingentes sino expresiones de problemas estructurales que son constitutivos del modelo de democracia realmente existente de una crisis economica moral intelectual politica que abarca todas las actividades de la vida lo que las regulaciones neolib erales recientes estan demostrando es la capacidad de reproduccion de un modelo de politica que se funda en la exclusion tiene las condiciones propicias para desarrollarse en la region mas desigual del planeta se trata de una estrategia de expansion de las relaciones capitalistas de produccion hacia ambitos antes preservados como servicios publicos fondos de pension salud educacion seguridad las carceles entre otros boron es asi que el impacto sobre las vidas concretas solo se reduce estadisticas desplazamientos poblacionales es posible afirmar que el recrudecimiento en las condiciones de vida el sistema de necesidades se traduce tambien en fenomenos como la escalada de violencia las restricciones de acceso multiples derech os de los grupos mas vulnerables pero lo contradictorio es el vinculo entre estas logicas de reproduccion de la desigualdad las instituciones de la democracia busguesa la relacion estructural entre desigualdad capitalismo es organica pues ambos se p resuponen para existir lo que obliga pensar en el lugar de los derechos dentro de la hegemonia capitalista sea en el rol legitimador que por un lado ciertas politicas sociales pueden jugar siempre que sean reguladas controladas siempre que afecten la reproduccion ampliada del capital su racionalidad en expansion como sistema de relaciones sociales un ejemplo puede ser esa postura ciertamente comun que considera que el peor deficit de las democracias regionales por lo tanto la verd

formulaciones de izquierda sobre las alternativas al neoliberalismo por ejemplo el que ciertas izquierdas adoptaran el neodesarrollismo como la postura realista para un socialismo del siglo xxi stolowicz la par el problema del estado en el socialismo como esta ampliado en de una nueva sociedad solo aparato que continua siendo un desafio para las izquierdas regionales de otras partes en consecuencia la superacion de la dicotomia liberal estado mercado el replanteo de la relacion publico privado como ejes de accion irrenunciables de acuerdo con stolowicz la formulacion del socialismo realista de la era posneoliberal se centro en hacer subir los individuos peor colocados en la escala social para evitar que la desigualdad social se prof undice una supuesta concepcion de igualdad en la diversidad que sostiene termina siendo una justificacion de la acumulacion capitalista un modelo explica donde la distribucion del ingreso las riquezas necesita ser igual solo ventajosa para todo los puestos de autoridad mando accesibles para los diversos grupos sociales mientras el obrero productor se transforma en trabajador consumidor como en el caso particular de la universalizacion de los celulares stolowicz el problema consi ste en que en apariencia la explotacion desaparece pero se mantiene un control total del capital sobre la subjetividad las practicas de los individuos de acuerdo con esta formulacion el conflicto con el capital se dirime solo en el mercado como domi nacion por eso el objetivo socialista de reducir la desigualdad se lleva cabo con las politicas sociales para reducir la desigualdad de genero etnica educativa de manera focalizada para hacer subir los mas desventajados en sus ingresos asi co mo acciones para crear una nueva hegemonia cultural este socialismo es concebido ademas como un 'movimiento ' por 'dentro ' por 'fuera ' del estado de sucesivas transformaciones que obstruyen la reproduccion de las desigualdades amplian las condic iones de igualdad que esta pensado en relacion con algun modo de produccion determinado sin embargo es visible que la base material de ese socialismo realista esta pensada desde el neodesarrollismo en este movimiento que lo es todo el incrementa lismo democratico liberal republicano parece encontrar ningun limite en la reaccion del capital para preservar su poder es una acumulacion democratica sin sobresaltos stolowicz para beatriz stolowicz la discusion posliberalismo anticapital ismo puede enfocarse en el neodesarrollismo transnacional ni en lo que denomina las posturas posliberales de la derecha en la

medios sino de fines sobre la direccion hacia donde caminar reformulada como posliberalismo anticapitalismo apunta precisa mente exhibir el objetivo de las reformas posliberales de perpetuar al capitalismo realmente existente de que solo reduciendo el poder del capital se puede superar al neoliberalismo stolowicz frente todo ello se impone la necesidad e pensar desde la condicion de subalternidad periferia como las logicas de desarrollo dependiente las formas liberales de racionalidad economica si bien son bases de modernizacion progreso tambien son generalmente complices en la estrategia de normalizar la precarizacion de la vida humana hacia una escalada de productivismo sin autonomia sin soberania sin derechos con los gobiernos progresistas el capital encontro un competidor un agente de subversion de ciertas practicas politicas tradi cionales que reaccionaba ante el avance neoliberal de entonces obstante sin cambios estructurales mayores tal vez sin siquiera las condiciones historicas para alcanzarlos las relaciones sociales capitalistas naturalizadas pudieron metabolizar l os procesos democratizadores rapidamente encauzarlos como materia prima para su desarrollo de una vez para siempre pero si en las circunstancias actuales de la lucha de hegemonias politicas el neoliberalismo articulado los fundamentalismos abre paso un nuevo momento por un lado este se basa en una nueva regulacion por el mercado de los recursos bienes incluido el capital humano el sistema de derechos asi como todas las pautas para redistribucion reconocimiento puestas en funci del intercambio mercantil privatizado de economias dependientes por otro los fundamentalismos ayudan reorientar redirigir la energia de la protesta asi como desmovilizar las instancias de lucha la precarizacion de la vida la intolerancia el miedo son aristas de una misma formula cuyo fin es unilateralizar la capacidad agencial humana hacia el productivismo la reproduccion tecnica deshumanizada del capital esta estructura articula agentes locales globales en torno un sector empresar ial privatizado privatizador que es la primera linea del despojo como por ejemplo en la creacion de intermediarios entre los campesinos el consumo de sus productos en supermercados asi sucesivamente se van articulando los sectores de inversion produccion ganancia hacia desde los ambitos
